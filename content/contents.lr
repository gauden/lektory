This is a skeleton Lektor website to be used as the scaffolding for building and deploying more complex sites (see [Github repo](https://github.com/gauden/lektory)).

There is nothing of substance here; it is just a shell, adapted from the one in the documentation with some of the settings tweaked to enable automatic deployment via Travis-CI (see the [README](https://github.com/gauden/lektory/blob/master/README.md)).

This repo also demonstrates:

- how to add a CNAME for serving from a custom domain (see the [`servers` settings](https://github.com/gauden/lektory/blob/master/Lektory.lektorproject))
- how to automatically deploy a plug-in (see the [`packages` settings](https://github.com/gauden/lektory/blob/master/Lektory.lektorproject) for the Creative Commons example)
